### **Specialist herbivore performance on introduced plants during native host decline**

My senior undergraduate thesis was published in *Environmental Entomology* in January 2023. It is free to view at this link: [https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvac107](https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvac107){.uri target="_blank"}.

During the socially-distant summer of 2020, I raised hundreds of caterpillars with the goal of helping to answer a single question: what will become of ash-eating insects once ash disappears (or nearly disappears) from New England and northeastern forests? To chip away at this mammoth question---all insects are sure to respond differently!---I reared three species of hawkmoth caterpillars on four different host plants in the same plant family as their primary host plant, ash.

Over the course of the experiment, I began to notice differences in how the three species tolerated each host plant: *Sphinx kalmiae* did quite well on lilac, but *Sphinx chersis* perished entirely on the same plant. These are the differences that colored my narrative. The problem of disappearing ash will not be discovered by painting in broad strokes.

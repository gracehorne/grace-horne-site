    "text": "Currently, at UC Davis, I volunteer with the Bohart Museum of Entomology whenever I get the chance. Regularly throughout the year, the Museum puts on open houses. Each open house has a theme, from ‘Beetles’ to ‘Insects in Agriculture,’ with experts and enthusiasts spreading their knowledge and answering questions. There is a focus on early education with crafts and tactile exhibits targeted towards little hands. These open houses are family friendly and open to the public. Visit their website for more details: https://bohart.ucdavis.edu.\n\n\n\nDuring college, I spent my summers interning at The Caterpillar Lab, an environmental outreach organization in my hometown of Marlborough, NH. With the Lab, I was able to travel across New England to libraries, classrooms, botanic gardens, farmers markets, museums of science, etc. We brought our mobile exhibits of caterpillars displaying defensive coloration, neat host plant associations, and interesting tales of population decline everywhere we went. A semi-comprehensive list of all of the programs I attended with The Caterpillar Lab is available in the outreach section of my CV. Visit their website for more details: https://www.thecaterpillarlab.org."

    "text": "Specialist Herbivore Performance on Introduced Plants During Native Host Decline\n\n\n\n\n\nMy senior undergraduate thesis was published in Environmental Entomology in January 2023. It is free to view at this link: https://academic.oup.com/ee/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ee/nvac107/6968949.\nDuring the socially-distant summer of 2020, I raised hundreds of caterpillars with the goal of helping to answer a single question: what will become of ash-eating insects once ash disappears (or nearly disappears) from New England and northeastern forests? To chip away at this mammoth question—all insects are sure to respond differently! (how differently is the true question)—I reared three different species of hawkmoth caterpillars on four different host plants in the same plant family as their primary host plant, ash.\nOver the course of the experiment, I started to notice differences in how the three species tolerated each host plant: Sphinx kalmiae did quite well on lilac, but Sphinx chersis perished entirely on the same plant. It’s these differences that became the theme of my narrative. The scope of the problem of disappearing ash will not be discovered by painting in broad strokes."

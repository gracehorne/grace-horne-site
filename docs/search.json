    "text": "I am interested in herbivore-plant interactions, especially between Lepidopterans and their food-plants. I seek to qualify how these relationships will shift in response to global change. I am eager to engage with community scientists in data collection and environmental education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n2021 - present\nUniversity of California, Davis\nPh.D. Entomology, in progress\nAdvisor: Dr. Emily Meineke\n\n2017 - 2021\nColby College, Waterville, ME\nB.A. Biology (honors) & Environmental Science\nMagna cum laude with distinction in both majors\nAdvisors: Drs. Justin Becknell & Judy Stone\nThesis: “Reduced performance of ash-specialist caterpillars on non-native, cultivated Oleaceous plants”\n\nSpring 2020\nRound River Conservation Studies, Maun, Botswana\n\nRound River Conservation Studies (RRCS) is an environmental organization operating at the nexus of conservation and education. We explored the complex relationship between conservation, people, and wildlife, mostly in Mababe, Botswana. We worked with local experts to design and maintain wildlife monitoring systems to be used to substantiate economic and environmental decisions. This program helped me to develop fluency in field work, responses to human-wildlife conflict, and communication with local stakeholders.\n\n\nTeaching\n\n\n\nWinters 2022 - 2025\nUC Davis Department of Entomology & Nematology, Davis, CA\nNatural History of Insects Guest Lecturer\nLecture: “Insects & Climate Change”\n\nFall 2022\nUC Davis Department of Environmental Science & Policy, Davis, CA\nGeneral Ecology Teaching Assistant\n\nSpring 2022\nUC Davis Department of Evolution & Ecology, Davis, CA\nIntroduction to Ecology Teaching Assistant\n\nFall 2018\nColby College Mathematics Department, Waterville, ME\nSeries and Multi-variable Calculus Teaching Assistant\n\n\nEmployment & Commissions\n\n\n2025\nIntern\nNative Plant Trust, Framingham, MA\n\nThe mission of Native Plant Trust (NPT) is to save rare and endangered plants through conservation, horticulture, and education. As part of my role at NPT, I contributed to the New England Plant Conservation Program (NEPCoP) by assisting in securing permission for rare plant surveys from a variety of land owners, including government agencies, NGOs, and private landowners.\n\n2025\nResearch Intern\nAppalachian Mountain Club Jackson, NH\n\nThe Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) aims to protect the outdoors from environmental threats. Their work runs the gamut from maintaining trails to administering a collection of high elevation huts to conducting observational research across New England’s alpine and sub-alpine zones. In my capacity as an intern, I helped develop an alpine pollinator monitoring project under the guidance of senior scientist Georgia Murray.\n\n2022 - 2024\nPicnic Day Co-Chair\nUniversity of California, Davis, CA\n\n2022 - 2023, 2025 - 2026\nEntomology Seminar Series Committee Member\nUniversity of California, Davis, CA\n\n2018 - 2021\nEducation Staff & Undergraduate Researcher\nThe Caterpillar Lab, Marlborough, NH\n\nThe Caterpillar Lab (TCL) is an environmental education organization focused on inviting people—kids and adults alike—to share in stories of ecology, evolution, and natural history. I have presented at over 30 locations including elementary school classrooms, botanic gardens, and children’s museums, |with a goal to ignite in us a curiosity of the world we live in, from the smallest leaf-miners to the tallest trees.\n\n2019 - 2020\nStudent Assistant\nColby College Olin Science Library, Waterville, ME\n\n2019\nColby Outdoor Orientation Trip (COOT) Leader\nColby College, Waterville, ME\n\n\nFellowships & Grants\n\n\nTotal funds awarded: $219,190\n\n\nExternal\n2024\nNSF INTERN Supplemental Funding for Non-Academic Research Internships ($52,795)\n\n2023\nNSF Graduate Research Fellowship ($147,000)\n\n2022\nCNPS Student Research Grant Award ($595)\n\nInternal\n2025\nDuffey Dingle Research Award ($1,300)\nMcBeth Memorial Scholarship ($950)\n\n2024\nEntomology Student Support Research Award\nHenry A.

Regularly throughout the year, the Museum puts on open houses. Each open house has a theme, from ‘Beetles’ to ‘Insects in Agriculture,’ with experts and enthusiasts spreading their knowledge and answering questions. There is a focus on early education with crafts and tactile exhibits targeted towards little hands. These open houses are family friendly and open to the public. Visit their website for more details: https://bohart.ucdavis.edu.\n\n\nThe Caterpillar Lab\nDuring college, I spent my summers interning at The Caterpillar Lab, an environmental outreach organization in my hometown of Marlborough, NH. With the Lab, I was able to travel across New England to libraries, classrooms, botanic gardens, farmers markets, museums of science, etc. We brought our mobile exhibits of caterpillars displaying defensive coloration, neat host plant associations, and interesting tales of population decline everywhere we went. A semi-comprehensive list of all of the programs I attended with The Caterpillar Lab is available in the outreach section of my CV.

This is a simple data set of the monthly atmospheric CO2 concentrations at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii from 1959 to 1997.\nTo start, we need to load some packages and our data. As is, the data is in the form of a time series. We want to convert it to a data frame.\n\n# load necessary packages - make sure you have these installed!\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(data.table)\n\n# load Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2 Concentration data\ndata(co2)\n\n# convert to a data frame\nco2 &lt;-\n  data.frame(\n    CO2 = as.numeric(co2),\n    month = rep(month.abb, 39),\n    year = rep(1959:1997, each = 12)\n  )\n\n# new column for date\nco2 &lt;- co2 %&gt;% # create a date column and convert to date format\n  # we know the measurement is taken on the 15th\n  mutate(date = paste(\"15\", month, year) %&gt;% \n           as.Date(., format = \"%d %b %Y\")) \n\nLet’s explore the data! Here are some easy ways to get a feel for your data.\n\nhead(co2) # view the first couple of rows of data\n\n     CO2 month year       date\n1 315.42   Jan 1959 1959-01-15\n2 316.31   Feb 1959 1959-02-15\n3 316.50   Mar 1959 1959-03-15\n4 317.56   Apr 1959 1959-04-15\n5 318.13   May 1959 1959-05-15\n6 318.00   Jun 1959 1959-06-15\n\ntail(co2) # view the last couple of rows of data\n\n       CO2 month year       date\n463 364.52   Jul 1997 1997-07-15\n464 362.57   Aug 1997 1997-08-15\n465 360.24   Sep 1997 1997-09-15\n466 360.83   Oct 1997 1997-10-15\n467 362.49   Nov 1997 1997-11-15\n468 364.34   Dec 1997 1997-12-15\n\nstr(co2) # take a look at the classes of data\n\n'data.frame':   468 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ CO2  : num  315 316 316 318 318 ...\n $ month: chr  \"Jan\" \"Feb\" \"Mar\" \"Apr\" ...\n $ year : int  1959 1959 1959 1959 1959 1959 1959 1959 1959 1959 ...\n $ date : Date, format: \"1959-01-15\" \"1959-02-15\" ...\n\n# make a line plot of the data\n# note that your plot will probably look aesteically different than\n# mine because I am using a base R inspired gg theme\nggplot(data = co2, aes(x = date, y = CO2)) + \n  geom_line(alpha = 0.5, color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow this is all well and good, but what if we wanted to know what happens after 1997. After all, some of the people in this room were born after that date and we want to know what has happened in our lifetimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statement may cause some contention in the room — proceed with caution gen-Zers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, let’s grab some data from the Scripps CO2 program. Because we are all hackers in the room, we are going to scrape data from the website programatically instead of downloading it and then importing it. We will write a function to do this for all of the sampling station locations we are interested in! Before we even think about writing a function, we want to make sure our code works for one site.\nNavigate to the following website and pick your favorite sampling station: https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/sampling_stations.html\nFor this example, I am going to pick our old friend the Mauna Loa Observatory, but I want you to pick a different one.\n\n# URL of the website containing the .csv files\nurl &lt;- \"https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/mlo.html\"\n\n# read the HTML content of the webpage\nwebpage &lt;- read_html(url)\n\n# find all links on the webpage\nlinks &lt;- webpage %&gt;% \n  html_nodes(\"a\") %&gt;% \n  html_attr(\"href\")\n\n# filter links that point to CSV files then\n# filter the links to only the file containing flask CO2 monthly readings\ncsv_links &lt;- tibble(link = links) %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(link, \".csv$\"),\n         str_detect(link, \"flask_co2/monthly\")) \n\nlink2file &lt;- csv_links[1]\n\n# download and import CSV file into R\nfile_url &lt;- paste0(\"https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu\", link2file)\nfilename &lt;- basename(file_url)\ndownload.file(file_url, destfile = filename, mode = \"wb\")\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(filename)\n\nview(data1)\n\nAck! There’s a bunch of junk at the top of the file. Let’s wrangle this sucker real fast. We know from viewing the file that the first column header is Yr so let’s just skip everything before that.\n\n# skip everything until the `Yr` column\ndata &lt;- fread(filename, \n      skip = \"Yr\", check.names = TRUE)\n\n# remove downloaded files\nfile.remove(filename)\n\nview(data)\n\nThat looks much better. All that junk was metadata. I’ll copy it below, but if you don’t trust me, you can go back and view data1.\n\nThe data file below contains 10 columns. Columns 1-4 give the dates in several redundant formats. Column 5 below gives monthly Mauna Loa CO2 concentrations in micro-mol CO2 per mole (ppm), reported on the 2012 SIO manometric mole fraction scale. This is the standard version of the data most often sought. The monthly values have been adjusted to 24:00 hours on the 15th of each month. Column 6 gives the same data after a seasonal adjustment to remove the quasi-regular seasonal cycle. The adjustment involves subtracting from the data a 4-harmonic fit with a linear gain factor. Column 7 is a smoothed version of the data generated from a stiff cubic spline function plus 4-harmonic functions with linear gain. Column 8 is the same smoothed version with the seasonal cycle removed. Column 9 is identical to Column 5 except that the missing values from Column 5 have been filled with values from Column 7. Column 10 is identical to Column 6 except missing values have been filled with values from Column 8. Missing values are denoted by -99.99. Column 11 is the 3-digit sampling station identifier.\n\nAlright. We know right off the bat that we are going to have to do some more wrangling here. I want to rename the columns to something that makes sense to me, then I want to delete the rows without data, then I want to replace missing values with NAs, and then I want to make the date column of class date.\n\n# make a vector of new names\nnew_names &lt;- c(\n  \"year\",\n  \"month\",\n  \"date_excel\",\n  \"date\",\n  \"co2\",\n  \"co2_season_adj\",\n  \"co2_smooth\",\n  \"co2_smooth_season_adj\",\n  \"co2_interpolated\",\n  \"co2_season_adj_interpolated\"\n)\n\n# replace old names\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~new_names, everything())\n\n# delete rows with no data\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;% slice(-c(1:2))\n\n# replace -99.99 or NaN with NAs\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate_all(~ ifelse(.x == -99.99 | .x == \"NaN\", NA_real_, .x))\n\n# reformat date column\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(as.numeric(date_excel) - 1, \n                        origin = \"1899-12-30\"))\n         \nview(data)\n\nYay, that looks nice :). I think we are ready to start making our functions!"
